### ‚úÖ Suggestions to Improve the README:

#### 1. **Add Screenshots or GIFs**

* **Why**: Visuals make the project more engaging and immediately show functionality.
* **How**: Add a section like:

```md
## üì∏ Screenshots

### üè† Homepage
![Homepage Screenshot](screenshots/homepage.png)

### üõí Cart Page
![Cart Screenshot](screenshots/cart.png)

### üîê Admin Dashboard
![Admin Screenshot](screenshots/admin.png)
```

#### 2. **Add a Demo Link (if deployed)**

If it's live, add:

```md
üîó **Live Demo**: [Visit Anime Store](https://your-live-url.com)
```

---

#### 3. **Improve SEO with Project Tags**

At the top, consider adding:

```md
> E-commerce ‚Ä¢ PHP ‚Ä¢ MySQL ‚Ä¢ phpMyAdmin ‚Ä¢ Anime Store ‚Ä¢ Admin Dashboard ‚Ä¢ Cart System
```

---

#### 4. **Mention Security Considerations**

It‚Äôs good practice to briefly say:

```md
> Note: For production, make sure to validate inputs, hash passwords, and use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
```

---

#### 5. **Add Credits or Resources Section**

For open-source image credits, tutorials used, or libraries:

```md
## üôè Credits

- Product images sourced from [XYZ Anime API](#) or [public domain].
- Based on e-commerce tutorial by [SomeAuthor](#).
```

---

### üîß Codebase/Project Suggestions:

#### 1. **Use Environment Configuration File**

Instead of hardcoding DB credentials in `db.php`, use:

```php
$db_host = getenv('DB_HOST');
$db_user = getenv('DB_USER');
```

And load them using a `.env` file with something like [PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv).

---

#### 2. **Secure Passwords**

If not already done, replace plain-text password storage with:

```php
password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
```

And verify with `password_verify()`.

---

#### 3. **Add .gitignore**

Ignore config and temp files:

```
.env
/vendor/
/node_modules/
*.log
```

---

#### 4. **Consider MVC Structure (Long-term Refactor)**

Over time, migrating to an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern will:

* Make your codebase cleaner
* Separate logic from UI
* Improve testability and scalability
